# What is this website

This website demonstrates a possible new way in which governments could poll their citizens about which policy measures they should adopt in order to meet multiple imposed ecological targets.

This is *not yet* a real government initiative. The data is *not yet* completely accurate. It is currently in a state used to shocase the concept, in order to find partners to turn it into a reality.

For a deep dive into the concept, you can read this [white paper](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ytbjbS6wYBoyYLthu/online-preferendum-to-select-climate-policy-measures).

### Context and targets

The context for this demowebsite is Flanders, Belgium, and the ecological targets are:

- The reduction of CO2-emissions imposed by a judge in a case called the '[Klimaatzaak](https://www.klimaatzaak.eu)' (climate case);
- The emission reduction goals imposed to Belgium as a European Union member state in the '[Effort Sharing Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_3543)' framework;
- [Energy efficiency](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en) (a reduction of used energy) and the percentage of [renewable energy](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en) in the energy production mix, two other targets imposed to all EU member states through European directives.

Additionally, the total cost of these measures is displayed, taking into account the cost or profit of [emission trading](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en), a practice where countries can either sell emission rights in case they emit less than expected, or buy the rights to emit more than expected from other states, on a public market.

Finally, the website displays the broader estimated impact of the selected measures, on two dimensions:

- The broad ecological impact, in the framework of the (remaining) [9 planetary boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html), scientific thresholds for Earth-system processes, beyond which humanity risks destabilizing the planet's capacity to support life;
- The broad socio-economical impact, in the framework of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals) (SDGs), 17 global goals set by the UN to achieve a sustainable, equitable, and prosperous world by 2030.
