  "helpProposals": "A list of sample measures compiled by VEKA for {{ region }} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. Preliminary examples, with rough estimates for emission reductions and arbitrary values for other impacts.",

  "helpLegalReductionTarget": "{{ region }} must reduce greenhouse gases by 55%, as ruled by a Judge in the Klimaatzaak.",

  "helpCarbonIncome": "EU states emitting less than their target can sell excess emission rights at an estimated €100 per ton of CO2.",
  "helpLegalPenalty": "If the government does not meet the legal target, after an evaluation period, a legal penalty of €1000000 per month must be paid.",

  "helpDialogProposals": "This list of sample measures was compiled by the Flemish Energy and Climate Agency (VEKA) following the ruling in the climate case, where the judge determined that Belgium and {{ region }} must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 to avoid disrupting the climate. These are currently just examples to get an idea of the magnitude of the impact. The values for emission reductions are rough estimates from VEKA. All other values are currently arbitrary.",
  "helpDialogResults": "All quantifiable targets {{ region }} must reach by 2030, imposed by both the Klimaatzaak judge (CO2 emissions) and by Europe (CO2 emissions, energy efficiency and renewable energy); the cost of selected measures; and their broader impact. Currently, only greenhouse gas impacts are quantified.",
  "helpDialogLegalReductionTarget": "The amount of greenhouse gases that {{ region }} needs to emit less by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, to avoid disrupting the climate, according to the judge in the Klimaatzaak. Greenhouse gases are CO2, which is emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels, and methane, which is emitted by various chemical processes. In the judge's ruling, unlike the European context, no distinction is made between sectors and whether or not emission rights in that sector are traded on an emissions market.",
  "helpDialogCo2reductionTarget": "The amount of greenhouse gases that {{ region }} needs to emit less by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, according to European regulations. Greenhouse gases are CO2, which is emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels, and methane, which is emitted by various chemical processes. Europe demands from all member states that they reduce their CO2 emissions by a certain amount. Emissions from energy and heavy industry are regulated on an emission market, the European Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). The emissions from other sectors must be reduced through policy measures. Belgium still needs to reduce these emissions by about 50,000 kilotons, divided among the regions.",
  "helpDialogCarbonTax": "When a European member state does not meet its CO2 reduction target, yearly, it must pay a tax equal to the amount of emissions it is below the target reduction requirement. The price of these missed reductions is determined by the ETS system; and cannot be determined beforehand. A realistic assumption is €100 per ton of CO2. \n\nThis would explain everythig in more detail, and link to estimations of the average emissions price.",
  "helpDialogCarbonIncome": "When a European member state emits less than its target, it can sell its excess emission rights to Europe. A realistic price assumption is €100 per ton of CO2.\n\nThis would explain everything in more detail, and link to estimations of the average emissions price.",
