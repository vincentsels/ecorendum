By selecting more measures, Belgium might receive additional funding instead.</li><li>If Belgium doesn't reduce its greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently, this means that other European member states will have to compensate - and they may be in a much more difficult position to do so. We can only meet the goals if everyone does his part.</li><li>There is no guarantee that other member states will be able to compensate. Not meeting the greenhouse gas reduction targets almost ensures that the world will go to shits. Yes, this must be rephrased a bit still. TODO.</li></ul>",

  "helpProposals": "VEKA compiled a list of measures for Belgium to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. These are preliminary examples with rough estimates for emission reductions and arbitrary values for other impacts.",
  "helpLegalReductionTarget": "Belgium must reduce greenhouse gases by 2030 from 1990 levels, including CO2 and methane, without sector-specific distinctions or emission trading considerations.",
  "helpCo2reductionTarget": "Belgium must reduce greenhouse gases, including CO2 from fossil fuels and methane, to meet European targets. Around 50,000 kilotons reduction is needed, divided among regions, with different measures for various sectors.",
  "helpResults": "A judge mandated Belgium and Flanders to reduce greenhouse gases, aligning with Europe's ecological transition targets by 2030. This includes lowering CO2, enhancing energy efficiency, and increasing renewable energy. Currently, only greenhouse gas impacts are quantified.",
  "helpCo2targetKt": "Details on how Belgium's 50,000 kiloton CO2 reduction target was calculated.",
  "helpCarbonTax": "EU states failing to meet CO2 targets pay a tax based on ETS system prices, estimated at €100 per ton of CO2. This section provides detailed links and average emissions price estimations.",
  "helpCarbonIncome": "EU states emitting less than their target can sell excess emission rights at an estimated €100 per ton of CO2. This section offers detailed links and average emissions price estimations.",

  "helpDialogProposals": "This list of sample measures was compiled by the Flemish Energy and Climate Agency (VEKA) following the ruling in the climate case, where the judge determined that Belgium must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 to avoid disrupting the climate. These are currently just examples to get an idea of the magnitude of the impact. The values for emission reductions are rough estimates from VEKA. All other values are currently arbitrary.",
  "helpDialogLegalReductionTarget": "The amount of greenhouse gases that Belgium (and each region) must reduce by 2030 compared to 1990 to avoid disrupting the climate. Greenhouse gases are CO2, which is emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels, and methane, which is emitted by various chemical processes. In the judge's ruling, unlike the European context, no distinction is made between sectors and whether or not emission rights in that sector are traded on an emissions market.",
  "helpDialogCo2reductionTarget": "The amount of greenhouse gases that we need to emit less according to European regulations. Greenhouse gases are CO2, which is emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels, and methane, which is emitted by various chemical processes. Europe demands from all member states that they reduce their CO2 emissions by a certain amount. Emissions from energy and heavy industry are regulated on an emission market. The emissions from other sectors must be reduced through policy measures. Belgium still needs to reduce these emissions by about 50,000 kilotons, divided among the regions.",
  "helpDialogResults": "The judge ruled that Belgium and Flanders must contribute their fair share to the reduction of greenhouse gases. Europe also demands from all member states that they meet various objectives related to the transition to an ecological society. Each member state is given a first set of targets to be achieved by 2030. Belgium must further reduce its CO2 emissions, improve its energy efficiency, and add more renewable energy to the energy production mix. Finally, the cost and the broader socio-ecological impact are outlined. For now, only the impact on greenhouse gases has been quantified, all other results are arbitrary figures.",
  "helpDialogCo2targetKt": "Click to find out how we calculated the 50 000 kiloton reduction still to be met.",
  "helpDialogCarbonTax": "When a European member state does not meet its CO2 reduction target, yearly, it must pay a tax equal to the amount of emissions it is below the target reduction requirement. The price of these missed reductions is determined by the ETS system; and cannot be determined beforehand. A realistic assumption is €100 per ton of CO2. \n\nThis would explain everythig in more detail, and link to estimations of the average emissions price.",
  "helpDialogCarbonIncome": "When a European member state emits less than its target, it can sell its excess emission rights to Europe. A realistic price assumption is €100 per ton of CO2.\n\nThis would explain everything in more detail, and link to estimations of the average emissions price.",
