The amount of greenhouse gases that Flanders needs to emit less by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, according to the judge in the [Climate Case](https://www.klimaatzaak.eu/). Greenhouse gases are CO2, which is emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels, and methane, which is emitted by various chemical processes. In the judge's ruling, unlike the European context, no distinction is made between ETS and ESR sectors; the overall emissions of Belgium count.

### Calculation

This number was calculated by VEKA.

- In 1990 Flanders emitted 86.8 Mt CO2-eq
- A 55% reduction translates into a 2030 goal of 39.06 Mt.
- In 2021 (last available numbers), Flanders emitted 73.4 Mt.
- That still leaves a gap of **34.3 Mt**.
- Note that of that, already 18.7 Mt are committed:
  - 12.8 Mt as ESR measures in the VEKP
  - 3.9 Mt through the DRI installation at Arcelor
  - 2 Mt through various CCS projects
