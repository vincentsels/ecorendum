The amount of greenhouse gases that Flanders needs to emit less by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, according to European regulations. Greenhouse gases are CO2, which is emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels, and methane, which is emitted by various chemical processes. Europe demands from all member states that they reduce their CO2 emissions by a certain amount. Emissions from energy and heavy industry are regulated on an emission market, the European Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). The emissions from other sectors must be reduced through policy measures under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR)

### Calculation

The number is based on the EU ESR target of 47% for Belgium. The federal government, Brussels and Wallonia all recognize this 47%. Flanders currently only targets 40%, leaving a large gap nationally (reducing only 42.6% nationally). As long as the different regions haven't come to an agreement of how to divide the efforts, this tool assumes Flanders should also achieve a 47% reduction. Note that in the European context, this only includes the ESR-sectors (road transport, buildings, agriculture, small industry, waste management), no ETS-sectors (electricity and heat generation, large industry, aviation and maritime transport).

Our calculation is as follows:

- In 2005 Flanders emitted 50.4 Mt CO2-eq (under the 'recalculated' framework)
- A 47% reduction translates into a 2030 goal of 26.7 Mt.
- In 2021 (last available numbers), Flanders emitted 43.7 Mt.
- That still leaves a gap of **17 Mt**.
- Note that of that, already 12.8 Mt is already committed in the VEKP.
