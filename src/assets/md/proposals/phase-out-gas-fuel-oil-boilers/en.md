Compared to the efforts already foreseen in the draft UNEP, an additional effort of 3 Mtonne CO2-eq is required. This is the equivalent of 30% of the remaining emissions in 2030. This could be met by:

- Turning off the gas/oil tap in 30% of homes;
- Providing 30% of homes with additional heat pumps by 2030. With a replacement rate of 5%/year (lifespan of 20 years), this means **from 2024, a total ban on installation of gas and fuel oil boilers**. As this is product standardisation, this ban **will have to be introduced by the federal government**.
- If no additional energy savings than those already planned happen, **1 million additional heat pumps** will have to be installed **by 2030** in residential buildings. For non-residential buildings, this would amount to 70,000 heat pumps.
