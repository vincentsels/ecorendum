The Flemish Energy and Climate Plan (VEKP) 2021-2030 is a transversal policy plan and forms an important basis for the Flemish energy and climate policy for the period 2021-2030.

On 12 May 2023, the Flemish government approved a new Flemish Energy and Climate Plan (VEKP). This is an update of the initial VEKP approved in 2019. With this plan, efforts are being stepped up in the transport, buildings, agriculture, (light) industry and waste sectors, the so-called ESA sectors. The ambition in the new 2021-2030 VEKP in terms of **reduction of greenhouse gas emissions** in the ESA sectors is thus increased to **-40% by 2030** (compared to 2005)

Flanders commits to the following targets:

- Greenhouse gas reduction in the ESA sectors: -40% by 2030 compared to 2005
- LULUCF sector: Flanders commits to meeting the requirements of the new Regulation in a Belgian context, i.e. the no-debit rule for the period 2021-2025, and to contribute to the 320 kt CO2-eq additional storage by 2030
- Energy savings (Art. 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive): 91.845 TWh
- Renewable energy: 31,974 GWh by 2030

The Flemish Energy and Climate Plan is divided into eight parts:

1. Introduction, policy framework and process
2. Decarbonisation: greenhouse gas emissions and removals
3. Decarbonisation: renewable energy
4. Energy efficiency
5. Energy security and internal energy market
6. Energy poverty
7. Research, innovation and competitiveness
8. Impact analysis and financing
