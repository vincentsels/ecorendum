In the transport sector, projected emissions in 2030 (WAM scenario VEKP) must be reduced by about half (45%).

- For passenger cars, this means that half of the fossil car fleet in 2030 (about 2.4 fossil cars in WAM scenario) must be additionally replaced by electric cars. This results in an electric car fleet of about 2.4 million electric cars in 2030 (1.2 already foreseen in VEKP + about 1.2 extra). With annual sales of magnitude 300,00 cars in Flanders, this means **a total ban on fossil car sales from 2024**. As this concerns product standardisation, this **ban will have to be introduced by the federal government**.

- The same reasoning can also be made for vans and trucks. To achieve 45% additional reduction in 2030 compared to the VEKP WAM projection, a **total ban** (by the federal government) on the sale of fossil vans and trucks must be introduced as soon as possible.
