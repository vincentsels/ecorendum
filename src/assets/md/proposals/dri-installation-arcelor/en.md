ArcelorMittal announces it has signed a letter of intent with the Belgian and Flemish governments to support a â‚¬1.1 billion project to build a 2.5-million-tonne direct reduced iron (DRI) plant at its Gent site, as well as two new electric furnaces.

A DRI plant uses natural gas and eventually possibly hydrogen, instead of coal, to reduce iron ore, leading to a large reduction in CO2 emissions compared to producing steel via the blast furnace route. The two electric furnaces will melt the 'direct reduced iron' (DRI) and steel scrap, which will then be converted into slabs at the steel plant and then further processed into finished products.

Once the DRI plant and electric furnaces are built, there will be a transition period during which production will gradually shift from blast furnace A to the DRI plant and electric furnaces, after which blast furnace A will be closed as it will have reached the end of its life. By 2030, this will lead to a reduction of about 3 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.

The support of both the Belgian and Flemish governments for this project is crucial given the significant costs associated with the transition to carbon-neutral steel production.

European Commission approval for the financial support will also be needed.

### Synergies between Smart Carbon and DRI

The DRI plant will operate alongside the Ghent B blast furnace, which restarted production in March 2021 after a significant investment of 195 million euros.

Several decarbonisation initiatives, including the commissioning of the Steelanol/Carbalyst and Torero projects in Ghent in 2022, will reduce annual CO2 emissions by around 0.9 million tonnes by 2030.

The combination of the new DRI plant with a sustainable, state-of-the art blast furnace allows for unique synergies in ArcelorMittal Belgium's roadmap towards climate-neutral steel production.

Together, the various initiatives will enable ArcelorMittal Belgium to reduce its CO2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes per year by 2030 (on a scope 1 and scope 2 basis, compared to 2018), equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions of 848,172 cars driven for a year. As a result, ArcelorMittal Belgium will make a significant contribution to ArcelorMittal Europe's ambition to reduce its CO2 emission intensity by 35% by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2050.

### Roadmap to 2050

The approach of the hybrid steel production model Smart Carbon and Innovative DRI in Gent fits into ArcelorMittal Belgium's CO2 roadmap, which consists of three axes:

* Further improving material and energy efficiency and increased scrap usage

* The implementation of Smart Carbon technologies:
    * Replacing fossil carbon with circular and waste carbon: 'Fresh' raw materials will increasingly be replaced by waste products, in an ecologically and economically feasible way. The Torero project will pre-treat waste wood from container parks to produce biocoal suitable for the blast furnace process. ArcelorMittal Belgium also has demonstration projects underway with plastic waste that could be injected into the blast furnaces in the form of powder or gas.
    * Transforming residual gas into useful chemicals: In 2022, ArcelorMittal Belgium will commission the Steelanol/Carbalyst plant to biologically convert gas from the steel production process into bioethanol.
    * Separating CO2 for reuse or storage (CCS).

* Hydrogen: replacing carbon as a reducing agent with hydrogen (eventually with green hydrogen when it becomes commercially available).
