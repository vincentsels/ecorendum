Compared to the efforts already foreseen in the draft VEKP, an additional effort of 1 Mton CO2-eq is required. Several technological measures were already calculated in the May 2023 VEKP in the livestock and greenhouse horticulture sectors. Additional technological opportunities are limited, especially in the short term. The only credible additional reduction can be achieved by reducing the livestock population. This could be achieved by:

- **30% cattle and pig herd reduction by 2030 compared to 2021**. For the pig herd, the current reduction rate would have to accelerate slightly, for beef cattle the rate would have to triple, and for dairy cattle the upward trend would have to be completely reversed. Flanders would have about 400,000 fewer cattle by 2030. Intervening in the poultry population has little effect.
- Put a **cap** on further growth of the **dairy herd**, and reduce the **rest of cattle by 70%** (the current, natural reduction rate would go x7).
- Put a **cap** on further growth of the **dairy herd**, reduce the **rest of cattle by 30%, and halve the pig herd** (current target x2). 

Within arable farming, emission reductions are only possible by sharply tightening fertiliser standards (beyond draft MAP). Within greenhouse horticulture, additional energy efficiency is still possible, but not in the short term. Together, we are talking about a few tenths of a megaton CO2eq of potential additional reduction in the long term, thus largely insufficient to reach 1 Mton in 2030. **Livestock reduction is necessary in every scenario**.
